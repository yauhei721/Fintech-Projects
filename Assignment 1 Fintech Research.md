# OVERBOND - a Fixed Income Analyst


## Overview and Origin

Overbond is a canadian fintech company specializing in fixed income product analysis. The company is headquartered in Toronto. Vuk Magdelinic, a capital markets and technogy expert, and Han Ryoo, a verteran at the CIBC World Markets' Toronto corportae bond origination desk, co-founded the company in 2015. 

In an inital round of funding, the company received $7.5 million from group led by Marrison Financial. Subsequently, they are supported by their client base. Their clients includes some  issuers like major power utilities and real estate companies. From the dealer side, the company serves banks internationally including banks from Canada, the US, and the UK.


## Business Activities

The over the counter (OTC) bond market is historically a fractured market for data dissemination. Unlike equity, of which public trading platform and pricing are readily available, the bond market is not transparent in trading and pricing.

With the emergence of machine-learning technology, Overbond tries to solve this problem by using its proprietary data analysis and machine learning technology, as well as innnovative visualization techniques. Some products of Overbond are a cloud-based pricing communication platform that automates tasks for bond issuers and dealers. Chief executive Vuk Magdelinic says the Overbond's digital platform allows more dealers to trade at once, which helps to increase volume and offer greater pricing transparency.

The global bond market is estimated to be at \\$119 trillion, with the size of the US bond market alone is \\$46 trillon. Unlike the equity market, where most stocks are listed and traded in public exchanges. Nearly all of the average daily trading of the bond market takes place in decentralized OTC markets. Overbond's target customers are all the players in the bond market including the Institutional investors, the Bond Issuers, and the Sell side dealers. For each group of target customers, Overbond has a specific solution suite for them.

Overbond R&D Labs is part of accelerator fintech partnership with four leading Canadian universities - University of Montreal, HEC Montreal, Concordia University and Queen's University. We are also a proud member of the Institute of Data Valorization (IVADO) in the Montreal MILA cluster. The company is offering its service and analysis with advance AI and machine learning techniques and deep datasets from their data suppliers.

They are currently using a system that start from data to create meaningful indicators or executions for their clients. First, there is a AI driven data aggregation process of multi-source data inputs. From their sources of data suppliers, the Overbond platform fetches raw live trading and fundamental data. The suppliers may include Refinitiv, S&P Global Market Intelligence, ICE, EDI, Euroclear and FINRA TRACE, and major credit agencies. Besides, the system also collect information of companies fundamentals, dealer quotations, internal client executed trade records.

Next, the system can applies a rules based data cleansing and normalization process to generate from the multiple data sources into a golden copy of the reference data. Then, clients can use the golden data to derive meaningful results by empolying AI modelling without doing the lengthy data sourcing and data re-structuring integration projects on their own.

After forming their own opinion, Overbond provide with their clients automatic trading technolgy to implement their trade. So Traders can train and customize AI models with their internal data to find a competitive edge in the market. Corporate and Government Bond Intelligence (COBI) is a product provided from Overbond using properitary AI algorithms developed at the Overbond R&D Labs. This is a sandbox environment for rapid prototyping for their clients. 


## Landscape

Overbond is in the Enterprise solutions industry that specifically provide Financial Data Analysis with Big Data and automated trading services. In this industry landscape, the major trends are the 4Vs, which are Volume (bigger data sets), Velocity (faster analysis), Variety of data sources, Value (created).

One of the major player in this field is Refinitiv and, more traditionally, Bloomberg. Founded in 2018, Refinitiv is valued at \\$27 Billion in August 2019.  Its annual revuenue is approximately $6.25 billion, and it has over 40,000 customers and 400,000 end users across 190 countries.

## Results

Comparing to Refinitiv, Overbond has a smaller client base. Data online regarding the client details are quite private and secretive. Some figures that shed insight on the company's performance are that it has total of about 200 clients in 20-18 and it has annual revenue of 46 million. Some notable clients of the company are Burger King, Molson Coors Brewing, etc..

In recent news, the company successfully integrated with FSA’s eFICC to automate RFQs. Integrated with IPC to provide voice to AI trading. And it is partnering with IPC to accelerate automation of fixed income trading with Voice-to-AI to capture data.

In terms of measuring success, I think that it is important for a data analysis company to be measured in number of users, related trade volume, and technology advancement (e.g. number of patent issued or patent applications filed). 

As mentioned before, Overbond does not publish much about its client base. However, we can estimate that their precense is global as Overbond has offices in Canada, New York, and London. It has a first-mover advantage in the fixed income market, and that will help the comapny to acquire client base.

The company does not have a lot of patent filed. Comparing to Refinitiv, Overbond has 2 patents vs Refinitiv has more than 700.

## Recommendations

One area for extra growth potential may be real time mobile app for retail investors or accredited investors. There are demands for bonds and other fixed income product in the general accredited investors. However, there is not much channel for them to access the market. The company can provide some of its services or partially open its data analysis tools to retail investors, so they can use them to get information or be matched with primary offerring from the issuer. For example, Overbond can partner with banks to offer AI trading platform for fixed income trading to the general public or selected investors.

I think that this is a Blue Ocean market for the company. In the past few years, we can see the rise in power from the retail investors. Collectively, they can be as strong as any investment banks or large corporation. With the power of AI, we have the capability of collecting and analyzing the preference and trend of the retail investors.

To offer this new service, the company will need to create a new user interfaces. The UX design must be simpler and easier to use. That can include more precise data presentation, so it does not take a professional to analyze the data to make decision. A new module of the data colletion software should also be built to collect data from the user base. These technologies are readily availbale and should be easy to implement.
